Basic functionality
-Validate that the addresses entered are actually addresses
-Make it so the 'X' removes an line of items from the set
-Fix time and date boxes so the show the full date no matter what the screen size it
-Display calendar starting from the date of the first event
-Be sure to deal with the calendar timezone
(I should probably make the list of places an array of objects, then push that array through each funtion)

Advanced items
-Include traffic in calculation?
-Add arrows so you can reorder the items in the list (or, even better, drag-and-drop)
-Using the given route, add a list at the bottom of suggested places to visit
-Combine it to a chrome extention (attaches to google account?? Need a way to save it- maybe all the info is in a google sheet
    then just displays on the webpage)
-Can save links to each location
-Create a queue of possible places and then you take item from the queue and put them on the actual list to calculate timing and price
    (add price option too)
